So I read a journal titled "Feature selection and regression methods for stock
price prediction using technical indicators " by Fatemeh Moodi, Amir Jahangard-Rafsanjani
, Sajad Zarifzadeh. In the paper they use technical indicators from Pandas_TA library as
features for the target columns which is Close. I follow one of their best method which is
Linear Regression and using Sequential Forward Selection as my feature selection method.

They use AAPL stocks for the research and I implement the method to one of the conglomeration stock in Indonesia, SRTG.JK or Saratoga Investama Sedaya Tbk. from Indonesian Stock Exchange
